## What is this

The "Fizz-Buzz test" is an interview question designed to help filter out the 99.5% of programming job candidates who can't seem to program their way out of a wet paper bag. The text of the programming assignment is as follows:

    "Write a program that prints the numbers from 1 to 100. But for multiples of three print “Fizz” instead of the number and for the multiples of five print “Buzz”. For numbers which are multiples of both three and five print “FizzBuzz”."

This code is extra commented for educative purposes.

## How to compile

The code was tested with GNU GCC, but should compile with any standard C++ compiler

For Windows users, I recommend the great Embarcadero Dev-Cpp
